    "\n",
    "The workflow consists of several key steps:\n",
    "1. **Setup**: Configure language models and embedding models\n",
    "2. **Data Preparation**: Prepare OpenAI posts data\n",
    "3. **Information Extraction**: Extract facts from posts\n",
    "4. **Knowledge Graph Construction**: Build relationships and create the graph\n",
    "5. **Visualization**: Visualize the final knowledge graph\n"
